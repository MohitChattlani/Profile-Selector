# Profile-Selector
This is basically an application that lets you select any profile from the select option.It uses basic html,css and jquery - a popular library of javascript to make requests to other webpages,get content from them and make changes on the current page itself without changing the URL or reloading the page itself.


To run this application you need to clone my repository 
and then host it on a localhost like 200 OK for chrome- https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en or you can also use a local server like XAMPP for windows-32 bit https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html ,WAMP for windows -64 bit http://www.wampserver.com/en/ and MAMP for mac users https://www.mamp.info/en/ .

Any feedbacks,issues 
and contributions are welcome.
